Getting ros ~~core~~ running on an ev3.

Latest Status

- rospy talker-subscriber working. If you're looking for proof here is video http://youtu.be/ZgA7DgbuVEs
- roscore not working on the ev3
- All ROS dependencies have been built and installed. 
- see brickstrap-build-status.md for the steps I used.

Current todos:
------

- replicate the process. I've just kept rough notes and command line history of how I got it working the first time.
- test roscpp, and the motors and sensors
- build debs?
