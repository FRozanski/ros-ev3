ros-ev3
=======

Getting ros ~~core~~ running on an ev3.

Latest Status
------

- rospy talker-subscriber working. If you're looking for proof [here is video](http://youtu.be/ZgA7DgbuVEs)
- roscore not working on the ev3
- All ROS dependencies have been built and installed. 

See brickstrap-build-status.md for the steps I used.

Current ToDos:
------

- replicate the process. I've just kept rough notes and command line history of how I got it working the first time.
- test roscpp, and the motors and sensors
- build debs?
